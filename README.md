This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

3. Install npm into the folder. Type the following:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server. Type the following:

npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

In order to run the app on your phone use the network IP provided rather than localhost.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
